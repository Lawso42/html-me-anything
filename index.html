    <h1><p id="Title">Lawso's Journey Through Twitch</p></h1>
    <main>
        <article>
            <p>My journey began on May 12th, 2013, when I stumbled upon the streaming site, twitch.tv. 
        I began watching professional League of Legends streamers, but quickly found speedrunning, 
        namely games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Mega Man X. Eventually, I became 
        a regular in the Mega Man X 100% runner Domalix's <a href = https://www.twitch.tv/Domalix>channel</a>. After watching him for several 
        months, I decided to begin to learn to speedrun Mega Man X 100% myself.</p>

            <p><br>
            After finding and using all of the learning tools available, and setting up various programs 
        used for streaming, and practicing the various tricks and strategies in the game for several 
        months, I was finally ready to do my first speedruns. On October 27, 2014, I took the plunge
        and started my stream for the first time. It was a very rough start, many deaths, game overs
        and missed tricks later, I had completed my first speedrun: Mega Man X 100% in 1 hour, 20 minutes
        and 29 seconds. It was a feeling that was certainly a bit new to me, but the adreneline rush
        from finishing the end of the run was out of this world. Little did I know, I would be spending
        the majority of my spare time chasing that feeling again.</p>

        <p><br>
            Fast forward, 3 years later, and now speedrunning has become an everyday part of my life.
        I've been able to meet some of the best friends I will ever have, started my own charity speedrunning 
        organization, <a href = https://www.twitch.tv/RetroRaisers>Retro Raisers</a>,
        gone to my first GamesDoneQuick marathon, and even held two speedrunning world records.<br>
        What does the future hold in store for me? Only one things for sure, it'll be going fast!
